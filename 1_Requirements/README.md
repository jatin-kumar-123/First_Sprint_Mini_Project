## Defining the System

## SWOT Analysis
### Strengths
1. Easy to use interface.
2. Satisfacory results.
### Weaknesses
1. Not much functionalities are present.
2. More sophisticated systems may be present. 
### Opportunities
1. Apart from browsing images in the device, a functionality can be added to capture the image on the spot by opening the device's camera and classifying it.
### Threats
1. Unclear or blur images can produce incorrect results.
2. Images with non-biodegradable waste resembling like biodegradable waste can produce incorrect results and vice versa.

## 4 W's and 1 H
### Who
This model can help becoming a city the smart city. The garbage cleaning authority of the area and its workers will be benefitted.
### What
This is a software program that uses machine learning algorithms to identify if a waste item is biodegradable or non-biodegradable.
### When 
This can be used when there is immense work load on garbage centers for cleaning the big garbage heaps and additional man power is needed. Automated segregation can expedite the cleaning process.
### Where
This machine learning model can be integrated with IoT enabling robotic arms to slide waste items into their respective chambers (green or blue). This can be implemented in a dustbin or at a big garbage center. It can help making a city the smart city.
### How
The app takes in the image of a waste product, sends it to the machine learning model working at the backend, receives result from the model and displays the result.

## High Level Requirements
1. The user should be able to provide an input image to the system.
2. The system should classify the image and gives back result to the user.

## Low Level Requirements
1. The GUI app should contain a button to browse the image from user's system's directory.
2. The GUI app should contain a sufficient large screen to display the image selected by the user.
3. The app should be able to send the image to the machine learning model at the backend and should be able to retrieve back result.
4. The GUI app should contain an output screen to display the final result.
5. The GUI app should contian an exit button to close the app.
